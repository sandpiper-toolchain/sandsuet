# *sandsuet* data specification

**What is it?** The *sandsuet* data specification gives a minimum set of criteria needed for rasterized geomorphology data to be immediately usable for analysis.

**How do I use it?** The specification should be applied data that have been checked for quality and potentially minimally processed. We recommend taking your model or experiment data and applying the *sandsuet* specification at the stage when you are about to begin analysis. 
This way, your analysis derives from the same data you will share at publication!
