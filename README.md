# *sandsuet* data specification

**What is it?** The *sandsuet* data specification gives a minimum set of criteria needed for rasterized geomorphology data to be immediately usable for analysis.

**How do I use it?** The specification should be applied data that have been checked for quality and potentially minimally processed. We recommend taking your model or experiment data and applying the *sandsuet* specification at the stage when you are about to begin analysis. 
This way, your analysis derives from the same data you will share at publication!

### Working with sandsuet data

* Explore the [Google Colab notebook here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WzITfkH0kAqAiYxe6xoxqaKDXBHKPiz7?usp=sharing) to see an example of data organized according to the *sandsuet* v1.0.0 data specification.
* The [*sandplover* software](https://github.com/sandpiper-toolchain/sandplover) is designed to work especially well with *sandsuet* data, and there are many helpful examples of working with that package in [the *sandplover* documentation](https://sandpiper-toolchain.org/sandplover/index.html).
